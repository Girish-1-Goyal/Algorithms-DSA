The contest is tough and causes much pressure
Without proper individual and team training = many mistakes occur even if members are strong
Typically other teams lead the scoreboard. You will recognize the easy 1-3 problems reasonably
For problems 4-6 the scoreboard also will highlight them but in a little rate. It might be misleading scoreboard
Avoid starting in a problem that not one tries so far!
Avoid problems solved only by the top 10 teams (it can be 8/10 success rate, and feels promising, but it is not)
Very early switch to 2-3 members per a problem
