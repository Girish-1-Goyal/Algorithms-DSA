As per contestant, we should have displine in tackling a problem.
	Team too should have displine in behaviour.
		Every team should relaize its skills, and develop strategy and practise it.
		

E.g. This was my team strategy in Regionals 2010.
	Code idea: the fast member (e.g. meeda) on PC and others are thinking and preparing staff for him.
		   We used this plan to utilize the special skills in the teams.

	1- Meeda will setup the environment, and write the template.
	2- Mostafa will sort the problems, and give a problem to Yasser and read another one.
	3- Team should manage reading all problems within 1st hour, discussing all problems (except n+1's) within another 30 minute
	4- If Mostafa or Yasser found an ace before Meeda finish they will give it to Meeda to solve it.
	5- If Meeda finished before finding an ace he will take the next problem to read.
	6- Mostafa and Yasser will be thinking and if they got a solution for a problem they will add it to Meeda's queue.
	7- Everyone should estimate the size of code & time carefully as much as possible.
	8- Meeda should utilize scoreboard as main guide for solving problems, and in case tie, work on shortest first
	9- Before writing any problem, Meeda should read the problem statement, input and output sections again.
	0- If Meeda finished writing a problem, Mostafa or Yasser will join him to review his code and put some corner cases.
	1- Yasser pipeline if: Meeda got stuck in a problem, or other teams can beat our score in case tie of problems
	2- Once Meeda's queue is empty, he joins the team and work in pair style or triple in last 1.5 hour
	3- Yasser and Mostafa keep working to sketch problems solutions until discovering n+1's problems
	4- Yasser and Mostafa work hard to find the easiest n+1, and write its code & revise it very well
	5- once Meeda finished all medium problems, all team work on writing the n+1 problem together
	6- After each hour, break-point is done to check team status and other teams scores & accepted proplems
	
	In Case WA Status:
		1- Fast revise for: Corner Cases, Limits, Output Format should be considered (May be original reader of problem join that) [10 Min]
		2- If no bugs, If Stress Test is effective, DO IT. [Max 10 min]
		3- Original reader of problem should get a printed copy and debug, while Meeda Navigate to next [10 Min]
		4- If no bugs, Pend the problem, and later, 3rd member may debug code or rewrite it from scratch
	
	Notes
		- Don't let a problem kills the team time
