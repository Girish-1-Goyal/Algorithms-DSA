Assume Team skills
	The 3 members are seniors: Very knowledgeable / skilled
	Assume their order based on CF/TC profiles
	Ziad = Fast coder, low rate of bugs, individual behaviour
	Saad = Fan of analyzing, like pair thinking, Not fast
	Hani = Not biased to a specific concern


The opening (1 problem, the ace)
	Goal: Find the easiest problem
	Ziad: Jump to the machine - prepare the code templates
	Saad: order problems based on length
	Saad / Hani: Inspect the problems very fast to find the easiest and push to Ziad to code
	
The early game (1-2 problems)
	Goal: Catch the other 1-2 easy problems
	Keep your eyes on the scoreboard for new ACs
	Avoid/Minimize idea/code reviews -Ziad on machine

The mid game (2-3)
	Team members read at least 75% of the problems
	Identify mid-level problems - reviewer role - code on paper - Owner types code to the terminal
	Short codes directly to the machine NOT on papers
	Check point after 1.5 & 3 hours
	Read all papers by 1.5-2 hours

The end game
	Donâ€™t open new problems if multiple non ACs
	Start with 1-code-2-think with rotations
	Switch to 3-in-1 when problems are very hard
